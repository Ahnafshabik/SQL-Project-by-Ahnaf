# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals

Analyzing E-commerce Data
Extracting insights and patterns
Identifying trends and opportunities

## Process

Step 1: Data Extraction
- Load the data from CSV files into a PostgreSQL database.

Step 2: Data Cleaning
- Identify and address issues like missing values and data inconsistencies.

Step 3: Data Transformation
- Perform operations like aggregations and joins to derive insights.

Step 4: Data Analysis
- Use SQL queries to answer specific questions and extract insights.

Step 5: Quality Assurance
- Verify data accuracy, test query performance, and review security measures.

Step 6: Presentation
- Compile results and insights into a concise and visually appealing format.

By following this step-by-step process, we were able to effectively transform and analyze the e-commerce data, leading to valuable insights and actionable recommendations.

## Results
During the analysis of the e-commerce data, several insights were gained and questions were answered:

1. The top-selling product was found to be from the United States, indicating a high demand for this particular product in that region.
2. Water bottles were identified as the most frequently ordered product, suggesting a strong preference for this item among customers.
3. The highest level of transaction revenues was primarily generated from North America (Specially, the United States), while there were no significant 
   transactions from Asia.
4. Additionally, it was discovered that the city of Chicago, United States, ranked first in terms of the average number of orders placed, highlighting a high level 
   of customer engagement and purchasing activity in that city.
5. The most popular product category was Men's T-Shirts in the Apparel segment, indicating a strong demand for this type of product.
 
## Challenges 

1. Dataset size: Analyzing the e-commerce data presented challenges due to the large size of the dataset. Dealing with a vast amount of data required efficient handling and processing techniques.

2. Data cleaning: Cleaning the dataset was a significant challenge. It involved identifying and handling missing values, removing irrelevant data, and ensuring data consistency and accuracy.

3. Identifying keys: Determining the primary and foreign keys in the dataset required careful examination and understanding of the data relationships. It involved analyzing the data structure and establishing connections between different tables.

4. Performance issues: Some queries faced performance issues due to the large dataset. Optimizing the queries and implementing efficient indexing strategies helped mitigate these challenges.

5. Understanding the dataset: The complexity of the dataset made it challenging to comprehend the data and its context. It required a thorough understanding of the e-commerce domain and the specific data attributes.

Overall, these challenges highlighted the importance of data management, data cleaning, performance optimization, and domain knowledge in effectively analyzing e-commerce data.
## Future Goals
Future Goals:

1. Create a new table with clean and organized data.
2. Develop a systematic and accurate approach to data cleaning.
3. Enhance the quality assurance process at every step.
4. Dive deeper into the dataset to uncover valuable insights.
5. Continuously improve data analysis skills and optimize processes.

By focusing on these future goals, I aim to improve data management, ensure data quality, and extract deeper insights from the dataset.
