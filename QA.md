What are your risk areas? Identify and describe them.


1. Data Integrity: There is a risk of data integrity issues, such as missing or incorrect data. It is crucial to ensure that the data loaded into the database accurately represents the source data and that there are no inconsistencies or discrepancies.

2. Data Quality: There may be data quality issues in terms of completeness, accuracy, consistency, and validity. It is important to validate the data and address any quality issues to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the analysis results.

3. Performance: As the dataset is large, there is a risk of performance issues, such as slow query execution or resource limitations. Optimizing queries, indexing, and considering efficient data retrieval strategies can help mitigate these risks.

4. Security: Protecting the data and ensuring data privacy is crucial. Risk areas include unauthorized access to the database, data breaches, and compliance with data protection regulations. Implementing proper security measures and access controls is necessary to mitigate these risks.

5. Assumptions and Limitations: It is important to identify any assumptions made during the analysis and be aware of any limitations of the dataset. Understanding the scope and limitations of the data can help avoid drawing incorrect conclusions or making unsupported claims.

By identifying these risk areas, one can develop strategies to address them and mitigate potential issues to ensure the accuracy, integrity, and security of the data analysis process.

QA Process:

A few of my data cleaning steps, along with the respective code, are given below:

1. Data Validation: Running SQL queries to verify the accuracy and integrity of the data (Table Name:all_sessions).
CODE:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM all_sessions;

2. Error Handling: Testing the system's response to erroneous inputs and ensuring appropriate error messages are displayed.

CODE: 
SELECT * FROM all_sessions WHERE visitId = 'invalid_id';

3. Performance Testing: Assessing the performance of SQL queries and optimizing slow queries for efficient data retrieval.

CODE: EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM all_sessions WHERE country = 'United States';

4. Security Review: Evaluating security measures and data privacy controls to ensure compliance with regulations.
   Note: Here in the code, the username and password are a demo value (for security purposes)

CODE: SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'AhnafShabik' AND password = 'password123';

5. User Acceptance Testing: Gathering feedback from end-users to validate the functionality and usability of the system.

Note: The table name 'all_sessions' is an actual table from the source data, however, this is also kind of an example for 
      all the other tables are like this.

CODE: SELECT * FROM all_sessions LIMIT 10;
